## ScrollView Keyboard Test


###Current Issue:

Upon inital VC load and you clicking in the TextView that would be hidden under the keyboard, the Notification Center sends out the notification and the keyboard will show and the ScrollView and TextField will move to just above the Keyboard Toolbar as expected.

If you were to dismiss the keyboard, the ScrollView and TextFields will return to the initial position. 

Unfortinatlty when you select any other TextFields, the keyboard will show, but the ScrollView and hidden TextFields fail to scroll above the keyboard like they did when the VC initally loaded.

Thanks for the assistance.
